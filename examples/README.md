# About examples

This directory is dedicated to the code for all small tests of our project. These samples should be used as examples. For exemple : Reading the CPU temperature or using leds...

## What is an example

Examples must be runnable as single files, with visible results, not only functions intended to the final product. 
And it must not be a final product. Just small showcases. Examples are small runnable programs that explain easyly how to use APIs or how to deal with some concepts. An example is always made in a teaching way.

## Please keep this in mind

- Don't push here final product content.
- Don't push non-runnable files
- Comment
- Try to explain how it works
- Keep it simple
